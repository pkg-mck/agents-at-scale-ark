# Team Selector Strategy

This sample shows how to create teams that use AI-driven participant selection instead of fixed execution order:

- AI model analyzes conversation history to choose the next team member
- Template-based selector prompts with customizable decision logic
- Dynamic team coordination based on member descriptions and context
- Flexible team composition with agents and sub-teams

## Setup

Run the quickstart command to get your cluster up and running:

```bash
devspace dev
```

You can create teams with selector strategy by applying the sample configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f samples/teams/selector-strategy.yaml
```

## Basic Usage

Create a simple research team with selector strategy:

```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Team
metadata:
  name: research-team
spec:
  strategy: selector
  members:
    - name: researcher
      type: agent
    - name: analyst
      type: agent
    - name: reviewer
      type: agent
  selector:
    agent: coordinator
```

Query the team and let AI choose the best participant for each step:

```bash
fark team research-team 'analyze market trends for electric vehicles'
```

The selector agent will automatically choose which team member should respond based on the conversation context and member descriptions.

## How It Works

1. **Agent Selection**: LLM analyzes conversation history and selects next participant
2. **Template Processing**: Fills selector prompt with team roles, participants, and history
3. **Participant Selection**: Agent returns name of selected team member
4. **Execution**: Selected member processes messages and adds response
5. **Loop**: Process repeats until max turns reached or team terminates

## Template Variables

The selector prompt supports these template variables:

- **`{{.Roles}}`**: List of team members with descriptions
- **`{{.Participants}}`**: Comma-separated list of member names  
- **`{{.History}}`**: Full conversation history

## Custom Selector Prompts

You can customize the selection logic by providing your own selector prompt:

```yaml
spec:
  selector:
    agent: coordinator
    selectorPrompt: |
      Select the best team member to respond next.

      Available roles: {{.Roles}}
      Conversation: {{.History}}
      Choose from: {{.Participants}}

      Return only the participant name.
```

## Configuration Examples

### Research Team
```yaml
spec:
  strategy: selector
  members:
    - name: researcher
      type: agent
    - name: analyst
      type: agent
    - name: reviewer
      type: agent
  selector:
    agent: coordinator
    selectorPrompt: |
      Research workflow coordinator. Select next participant:

      Roles: {{.Roles}}
      History: {{.History}}
      Options: {{.Participants}}

      Start with researcher, follow with analyst, end with reviewer.
```

### Consulting Team
```yaml
spec:
  strategy: selector
  members:
    - name: project-manager
      type: agent
    - name: consultant
      type: agent
  selector:
    agent: coordinator
    selectorPrompt: |
      Choose the most appropriate consultant based on expertise needed.

      Available: {{.Roles}}
      Context: {{.History}}
      Select from: {{.Participants}}
```

## Agent Descriptions

Team member descriptions guide the selector agent's decision-making:

```yaml
apiVersion: ark.mckinsey.com/v1alpha1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: research-analyst
spec:
  description: "Research and data analysis specialist"
```

### Best Practices
- Keep descriptions concise (2-4 words)
- Focus on expertise area or role function
- Use consistent terminology across team
- Avoid overlapping descriptions

## Selection Logic

### Exact Match
Model response must exactly match team member name.

### Fallback Behavior
If no exact match found:
- Uses first team member as fallback
- Logs selection method for debugging

### Duplicate Prevention
Prevents same member responding consecutively by using first member as fallback.

## Default Selector Prompt

When no custom `selectorPrompt` is specified:

```
You are in a role play game. The following roles are available:
{{.Roles}}.
Read the following conversation. Then select the next role from {{.Participants}} to play. Only return the role.

{{.History}}

Read the above conversation. Then select the next role from {{.Participants}} to play. Only return the role.
```

## Monitoring

Check team execution and selection decisions:

```bash
kubectl get events -o json | jq -r '.items[] | select(.message | contains("research-team")) | "\(.lastTimestamp) \(.type) \(.reason) \(.message)"' | sort
```

Selection events are recorded with:
- Selected participant name
- Available participants list  
- Selection method (exact_match, fallback_no_match)
- Team name and turn number

## Cleanup

Delete the selector strategy team resources:

```bash
kubectl delete -f samples/teams/selector-strategy.yaml
```
