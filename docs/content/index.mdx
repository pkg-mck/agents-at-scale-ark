# Ark - Agentic Runtime for Kubernetes

ARK is an Kubernetes-based platform that provides a runtime and enables management and orchestration of AI agents and their resources. It provides custom resource definitions (CRDs) and services to handle:

- AI model configurations
- Autonomous agents
- Multi-agent teams
- Tool integrations
- Memory persistence
- Performance evaluation

Follow the [Quickstart](./quickstart.mdx) guide to install Ark locally.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The Agents at Scale - Agentic platform and runtime for Kubernetes ("Ark") Technical Preview should **not** be run without reading the [Disclaimer](./disclaimer.mdx), which covers key risk topics.
>
> We are transitioning this project to our open-source repository. During this process we will be moving documentation URLs, artifact registries, etc. Some builds, artifacts and pipelines may be impacted.

Build, deploy and operate agentic solutions using proven patterns and practices that are reliable for complex distributed systems.

## Key Features

- Platform-agnostic agent operations
- Standardized deployment patterns
- Transparent orchestration
- Built-in evaluation capabilities
- Extensible tool integration
- Multi-agent coordination
- Custom headers support (for e.g. request tracing, custom metadata)


## Architecture

## Core Resources

- [**Models**](./user-guide/models/): Configure and connect to AI models. 
- [**Agents**](./user-guide/agents/): Create autonomous AI agents with specific capabilities and tools
- [**Teams**](./user-guide/teams/): Orchestrate multiple agents working together with coordination strategies
- [**Queries**](./user-guide/queries/): Execute prompts and manage conversations with agents or teams
- [**Tools**](./user-guide/tools/): Define custom tools and MCP tool references for agents
- [**MCPServers**](./user-guide/tools/): Configure Model Context Protocol servers for external integrations
- **Memory**: Persistent storage for agent conversations and state
- **Evaluator**: Services for assessing and scoring agent performance
- **Evaluation**: Define evaluation configurations and results
- **ExecutionEngine**: Specialized runtimes for different agent frameworks
- **A2AServer**: Agent-to-agent communication services

## MCP Servers

- **filesystem-mcp**: File system operations and management

## Services

- **ark-api**: REST API for managing ARK resources
- **ark-api-a2a**: Agent-to-agent communication gateway
- **ark-dashboard**: Web-based management interface
- **ark-mcp**: MCP server integration service
- **ark-evaluator**: Holistic evaluation and scoring service
- **localhost-gateway**: Local development gateway (only on local)
- **ark-cluster-memory**: Memory storage with streaming support

## Sample Services

- **langfuse**: Observability and tracing service
- **executor-langchain**: LangChain agent execution engine
