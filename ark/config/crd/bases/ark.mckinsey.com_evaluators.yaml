              EvaluatorSpec defines the configuration for an evaluator that can assess query performance.
              This allows query evaluations to be executed by different evaluation frameworks and systems,
              rather than the built-in evaluation engine.
              Evaluators work as services that process evaluation requests for queries and provide
              performance assessments and scoring.

                            A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
