# Quickstart

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed. Then run the following commands to install Ark:

```bash
# Install the 'ark' CLI:
npm install -g @agents-at-scale/ark

# Install Ark:
ark install

# Optionally configure a 'default' model to use for agents:
ark models create default

# Run the dashboard:
ark dashboard
```

You will need a Kubernetes cluster to install Ark into, you can use [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start), [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/), [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/) or similar to run a local cluster, as well as at least 2 CPU and 4 GiB RAM available. The `install` command will warn if any required dependencies are missing.

In most cases the default installation options will be sufficient. This will install the Ark dependencies, the controller, the APIs and the dashboard. You can optionally setup a `default` model that will be the default used by agents.

Detailed instructions on how to install specific componets, configure RBAC, setup CI/CD deployments and deploy to remote clusters are available in the [Deploying Ark](../operations-guide/deploying-ark) operations guide.

## Installing Fark

You can also install the [Fark](../developer-guide/cli-tools.mdx) (Fast Agentic Runtime Kit) CLI tool to manage agents, run queries and more.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation, see the [Troubleshooting](../reference/troubleshooting) guide.
