# Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting guide for challenges when installing or using Ark.

## Ark Installation

This section covers common issues and solutions when installing Ark on various platforms.

### Prerequisites

Before installing Ark, ensure you have:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v18 or later)
- A Kubernetes cluster (e.g.,  [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/), [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/), [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), or [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/)).
- kubectl and Helm

The easiest way to install dependencies on macOS:

```bash
brew install node kubectl helm

# Install a cluster such as:
# brew install minikube
# brew install kind
# brew install orbstack
```

Verify your cluster context:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

### Issues with Docker Desktop

If you are using Docker Desktop to launch your kubernetes cluster, you may encounter an issue where pods fail to start. When describing said pods, you may see an error like this.

```logs
Warning    Failed    pod/ark-controller-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx Error: container has runAsNonRoot and image will run as root
```

This is due to an the Docker Desktop Kubernetes cluster trying to run containers as root, when they shouldn't be.

To fix this, within your Docker Desktop Kubernetes set up:
 - Stop the Kubernetes cluster
 - Start the Kubernetes cluster again, but change the cluster type from Kubeadm to kind

### Installing Ark on Windows

Ark requires a Kubernetes cluster to run. There are a number of potential issues that can arise from permissions, organizational policies and so on, particularly around running Hypervisors (which is needed to run services like Docker and local Kubernetes clusters).

**WSL and Docker**

In most cases, you should install and enable [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) with Ubuntu or another Linux distribution.

You should then install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/). Hyper-V must be enabled. Enable Hyper-V and restart. Verify in "Task Manager" → "Performance" → "CPU" that "Virtualization" shows as "Enabled".

**Kubernetes Cluster**

Docker Desktop for Windows has Kubernetes support, go to wDocker Desktop Settings → Kubernetes → Enable Kubernetes.

Another option is [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) for Windows. Install and start with `minikube start`.

**Windows Installation Troubleshooting**

Many Windows installation issues stem from enterprise security policies and restricted environments. Potential issues are:

- Virtualization disabled - Hyper-V is often disabled by policy for security reasons
- Restricted user permissions - Standard users may not be able to modify system settings
- Security software - Endpoint protection may flag container operations as suspicious

**Node.js Installation Hangs**

Has been seen on some Windows installs. When the hang happens, terminate the installer, you can typically run `npm install -g @agents-at-scale/ark` and then install as normal, if not retry the Node.js installation.

**Missing Dependencies**

If `ark status` shows missing `kubectl` or `helm` then you local cluster is not setup, follow the guides above. The easiest way to install dependencies is via Chocolatey:

```bash
# Check system status
ark status
```

```powershell
# Install Chocolatey first (requires PowerShell as Administrator)
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

# Install the core dependencies.
choco install docker
choco install helm

# Install minikube if you want to use this as your cluster - this'll also install
# the kubectl binary.
choco install minikube

# Other cluster options are Kind and so on.
# choco install kind
```

**Minikube fails with "Hyper-V PowerShell Module is not available"**

Enable Hyper-V (requires restart):

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-Tools-All -All
```

If the error persists after restart, check if your organization has a specific tool or process for enabling Hyper-V. May require BIOS-level virtualization to be enabled.

**Minikube "IP not found" Errors**

Update WSL, delete and recreate the minikube cluster:

```powershell
wsl --update
minikube delete
minikube start
```

If using Docker Desktop, ensure it's running with proper permissions

**Security Software Blocking Operations**

If you are unable to install Hyper-V, WSL2, Docker or Kubernetes you may need to work with your organizations IT department to request access to services.

**Download Failures**

Failed downloads, network errors, disconnects and so on for packages or installations can sometimes be due to corporate VPN issues, which may be able to be temporarily disabled.

**Avoiding Kubernetes on Windows**

If Kubernetes or Docker cannot be run in your environment, the best solution would be to run a remote Kubernetes cluster, on AWS/GCP or similar. Check the [Operations Guide](../../operations-guide/deploying-ark) on how to do this.

## Agents

**Agents without a model show as 'Unavailable'**

Agents created prior to version `v0.1.34` that do not have a model set may show as "Unavailable" or have events such as `ModelNotFound`.

To resolve, set the agent `modelRef` to `default`. See [v0.1.34 Upgrade Guide](/reference/upgrading#v0134) for more details.
