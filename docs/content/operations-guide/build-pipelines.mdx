# Build Pipelines

## Pipelines

### CI/CD

The CI/CD pipeline builds and tests all ARK components, services, and documentation on every push. It includes library builds, single-platform container builds (AMD64) for testing, E2E testing, and release preparation.

### Deploy

The Deploy pipeline is run on demand to deploy:

- Documentation to GitHub Pages
- Multi-arch Containers to the configured container registry
- Helm chart to the configured container registry (under `/charts` path)
- ARK CLI to NPM registry
- ARK Python SDK to PyPI registry
- Ark to the configured distribution environment
- Ark to the configured AWS test environment
- Ark to the configured GKE test environment

The artifacts that are deployed can be selected when the pipeline is run, as well as the specific version tag to use.

## Release Management

ARK uses [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for automated release management based on conventional commits. The entire release process is automated and follows semantic versioning.  
Release please will create pull requests, update the changelog, and the CI/CD pipeline wil deploy the docs and modules and create versioning tags and labels.

### Release Flow

1. **Continuous Commit Analysis** (On every push to main)
   - Release Please runs after all CI checks pass (configured in `.github/workflows/cicd.yaml:716`)
   - Analyzes all commits since the last release using conventional commit format
   - Determines version bump based on commit types and current version:
     - For versions < 1.0.0 (current: 0.1.30):
       - `feat:` → Patch version bump (0.1.30 → 0.1.31) due to `bump-patch-for-minor-pre-major: true`
       - `fix:` → Patch version bump (0.1.30 → 0.1.31)
       - `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` → Minor version bump (0.1.30 → 0.2.0)
     - For versions ≥ 1.0.0:
       - `feat:` → Minor version bump (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
       - `fix:` → Patch version bump (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
       - `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` → Major version bump (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
     - Other types (`docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, etc.) → No version bump but included in changelog

2. **Automatic Release PR Management**
   - If unreleased changes exist, Release Please creates or updates a PR titled "chore(main): release X.X.X"
   - The PR contains:
     - Updated `.github/CHANGELOG.md` with aggregated changes since last release
     - Version updates in version files across the monorepo (defined in `.github/release-please-config.json`)
     - Consistent version synchronization across all packages, charts, and services

3. **Release Activation** (When Release PR is merged)
   - The CI/CD pipeline re-runs fully and creates a GitHub release with the new version tag
   - Changelog is automatically attached to the GitHub release
   - Sets `release_created` output to trigger downstream jobs:
      - **release-docs**: Deploys documentation to GitHub Pages
      - **release-libs**: Attaches Python wheel files to GitHub release
      - **release-chart**: Attaches Helm chart package to GitHub release
      - **release-ark-cli**: Attaches ARK CLI npm package to GitHub release
      - **run-deploy-workflow**: Triggers the Deploy workflow for distribution channels

### Version Synchronization

Release Please updates versions in the following locations:
- Root `version.txt`
- Python packages (`pyproject.toml` files)
- Helm charts (`Chart.yaml` files)
- Node.js packages (`package.json` files)
- Kubernetes manifests (`manager.yaml`)
- All service and library versions

### Validate PR Title

Ensures pull request titles follow conventional commit format described in the repository `CONTRIBUTING.md` for consistent squash merge messages.

### SonarQube Code Analysis (SCAS)

Automated code quality and security analysis. Expected to fail in open source repositories as it requires McKinsey-specific infrastructure.

## Recommended GitHub Configuration

Configure repository settings to enforce conventional commits for automated release management:

- General → Pull Requests: Enable only squash merging
- Branches → Branch Protection: Require `validate-title` status check and linear history

## Configuration

GitHub variables and secrets for ARK build and deployment workflows. All configuration is **optional** - if not provided, workflows will default to using GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

| Name | Type | Purpose | Default Value |
|------|------|---------|---------------|
| **Docker Registry (Production)** | | | |
| `DOCKER_REGISTRY` | Variable (Optional) | Main registry URL for version-tagged production/release images | `ghcr.io/{repository_owner}/{repository_name}` |
| `DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME` | Secret (Optional) | Username for main registry authentication | `${{ github.actor }}` |
| `DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` | Secret (Optional) | Password/token for main registry authentication | `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` |
| **CI Cache Registry (Build Artifacts)** | | | |
| `DOCKER_CICD_CACHE_REGISTRY` | Variable (Optional) | Registry URL for SHA-tagged intermediate images and CI/CD build cache | `ghcr.io/{repository_owner}/{repository_name}` |
| `DOCKER_CICD_CACHE_REGISTRY_USERNAME` | Secret (Optional) | Username for CI cache registry authentication | `${{ github.actor }}` |
| `DOCKER_CICD_CACHE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` | Secret (Optional) | Password/token for CI cache registry authentication | `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` |
| **Azure OpenAI (Testing)** | | |
| `CICD_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` | Secret | Azure OpenAI API key for E2E quickstart tests and evaluator | |
| `CICD_AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL` | Secret | Azure OpenAI base URL for E2E quickstart tests and evaluator | |
| **Distribution Environment Deployment** | | |
| `DEPLOY_CLUSTER_LOGIN_URL` | Secret | Kubernetes cluster login URL for centralized deployment environment | |
| `DEPLOY_CLUSTER_IDP_ISSUER_URL` | Secret | Identity provider issuer URL for cluster authentication | |
| **Documentation Site** | | |
| `DOCS_SITE_BASE_PATH` | Variable (Optional) | Base path for documentation site when serving from non-root URL (e.g., GitHub Pages) | |
| **NPM Registry (CLI Deployment)** | | |
| `NPM_TOKEN` | Secret (Optional) | NPM authentication token with publish permissions for CLI deployment | |
| **PyPI Registry (Python SDK Deployment)** | | |
| `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN` | Secret (Required for PyPI deployment) | TestPyPI authentication token for testing Python package deployment | |
| `PYPI_API_TOKEN` | Secret (Required for PyPI deployment) | PyPI authentication token with publish permissions for Python SDK deployment | |
| **Code Quality and Analysis** | | |
| `SONAR_TOKEN` | Secret | SonarQube authentication token |
| `SONAR_HOST_URL` | Secret | SonarQube server URL |
| `ARTIFACTORY_USER` | Secret | Artifactory username for dependency resolution |
| `ARTIFACTORY_PASS` | Secret | Artifactory password for dependency resolution |

## Troubleshooting

### Uppercase Organization Names

Unless otherwise specified, GHCR is used as the default Docker container registry, with the value `ghcr.io/<org_name>`. Docker registry names must be lowercase. If your GitHub organization name contains uppercase characters, you must explicitly set the Docker registry secrets with lowercase values. For example, for the organization `My-Org`, set:

```yaml
DOCKER_REGISTRY: "ghcr.io/my-org" 
DOCKER_CICD_CACHE_REGISTRY: "ghcr.io/my-org"
```

### GitHub Pages Documentation Deployment
When deploying documentation to GitHub Pages, the site is served from a subpath (e.g., `mckinsey.github.io/agents-at-scale-ark`). To ensure assets load correctly, set the `DOCS_SITE_BASE_PATH` repository variable to match your repository name:

```yaml
DOCS_SITE_BASE_PATH: "/agents-at-scale-ark"
```

This configures the Next.js build to serve all assets from the correct subpath. Without this setting, CSS, JavaScript, and images will fail to load when deployed to GitHub Pages.
