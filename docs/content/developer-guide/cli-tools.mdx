# CLI Tools

ARK provides two command-line tools for different use cases.

## Overview

### [fark](#fark) - Fast Agentic Runtime Kit
The primary tool for querying agents and teams, plus CRUD operations on ARK resources.

### [ark](#ark-cli) - ARK Management Interface
Interactive dashboard and system status monitoring tool.

## fark

`fark` is the primary CLI tool for querying agents and teams, plus managing ARK resources.

### Installation

#### From GitHub Release (Recommended)
```bash
# Download latest release for your platform
# Linux/macOS
curl -L "https://github.com/mckinsey/agents-at-scale-ark/releases/latest/download/fark_$(uname)_$(uname -m | sed 's/aarch64/arm64/').tar.gz" | tar xz
sudo mv fark /usr/local/bin/

# Windows: Download fark_Windows_x86_64.zip from releases page

# Verify installation
fark --help
```

#### From Source
```bash
# Clone and build from repository
git clone https://github.com/mckinsey/agents-at-scale-ark.git
cd agents-at-scale-ark
make fark-install

# Verify installation
fark --help
```

### Querying Agents and Teams

#### Agent Queries
```bash
# Basic agent query
fark agent weather "What's the weather today?"

# Math calculations
fark agent math "What is 15 * 23?"

# Location queries (uses get-coordinates tool)
fark agent location "Where is Paris?"

# Query with file input
fark agent weather -f input.txt "Analyze this weather data"

# Query with session management (requires memory service)
fark agent weather "What's the weather in NYC?" --session-id weather-session
fark agent weather "How about tomorrow?" --session-id weather-session
```

#### Team Queries
```bash
# Basic team query
fark team team-seq "Process this request"

# Query team with multiple agents
fark team team-seq "Calculate 2+2 and explain the result"
```

#### Query Management
```bash
# List all queries
fark query

# Trigger existing query
fark query weather-query

# Trigger with new input
fark query weather-query "What's the weather in London?"
```

### Resource Management

#### Listing Resources
```bash
# List all agents
fark get agent

# List all teams
fark get team

# List all models
fark get model

# List all tools
fark get tool

# Get specific resource details
fark get agent weather
```

#### Creating Resources
```bash
# Create agent from file
fark create agent my-agent -f samples/agents/math.yaml

# Create agent with prompt
fark create agent my-math --prompt "You're an agent helping with calculations" --model default

# Create agent with tools
fark create agent my-location --prompt "Help with location queries" --tools get-coordinates
```

#### Updating Resources
```bash
# Update agent from file
fark update agent math -f updated-agent.yaml

# Update agent prompt
fark update agent math --prompt "You're an advanced mathematical assistant"
```

#### Deleting Resources
```bash
# Delete specific agent
fark delete agent math

# Delete team
fark delete team team-seq
```

### Output Options
```bash
# JSON output
fark agent math "What is 5 + 3?" --json

# Verbose logging (shows token usage)
fark agent math "What is 5 + 3?" --verbose

# Silent mode (suppress event logging)
fark agent math "What is 5 + 3?" --silent
```

### Server Mode
fark can also run as an HTTP server providing REST API endpoints:

```bash
# Start server on default port 8080
fark server

# Start server on custom port
fark server --port 9090
```

### Shell Completion
```bash
# Install completion for zsh
fark completion zsh > ~/.fark-completion
echo "source ~/.fark-completion" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Install completion for bash
fark completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/fark
```

## ark CLI

`ark` provides an interactive dashboard and system monitoring capabilities.

### Installation

```bash
# Build and install from repository root
make ark-cli-install

# Verify installation
ark --help
```

### Interactive Menu

Launch the interactive menu interface:

```bash
ark
```

### System Status

Check the status of ARK services and components:

```bash
# Check overall system status
ark status
```

## Common Use Cases

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Create and test an agent
fark create agent test-math --prompt "You are a helpful math assistant"
fark agent test-math "What is 2 + 2?"

# Update and retest
fark update agent test-math --prompt "You are an advanced mathematical assistant"
fark agent test-math "Calculate the square root of 16"

# Clean up
fark delete agent test-math
```

### Production Monitoring
```bash
# Check system health
ark status

# Monitor specific resources
fark get agent
fark get team

# Query agents with structured output
fark agent weather "What's the weather?" --json
```

## k9s

k9s is a terminal-based UI for Kubernetes that lets you interactively manage and work with your cluster. It provides a visual interface to navigate, inspect, and modify Kubernetes resources including ARK resources such as agents, teams, models, and queries without memorizing complex kubectl commands.

### Installation

k9s can be installed separately and launched from your terminal. First, ensure your development environment is running:

```bash
# start development environment
devspace dev
# launch k9s
k9s
```

### Useful Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `?` | Show help and all available commands |
| `:crds` | Show all custom resource definitions (CRDs) including agents, models, teams |
| `:agents` | Show all agents in the cluster |
| `:models` | Show all models in the cluster |
| `:teams` | Show all teams in the cluster |
| `:pods` | Show all pods |
| `:svc` | Show all services |
| `:deploy` | Show all deployments |
| `d` | Describe the selected resource |
| `Shift+J` | Jump to owner (eg Agent â†’ MCP Server) |
| `Shift+A` | Sort resources by age |
| `e` | Edit the selected resource |
| `Ctrl+D` | Delete the selected resource |
| `l` | View logs for the selected pod |
| `s` | Shell into the selected pod |

Navigate to any resource type by typing `:` followed by the resource name. Use the arrow keys to select resources and the commands above to interact with them.

## kubectl

`kubectl` is the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. It's essential for managing ARK resources and troubleshooting applications.

### Installation

```bash
# macOS
brew install kubectl

# Linux
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x kubectl
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

# Windows
choco install kubernetes-cli
```

### Basic Commands

#### View ARK Resources

```bash
# List all pods in the default namespace
kubectl get pods

# List all ARK custom resources
kubectl get queries,agents,teams,models

# Get detailed information about a specific query
kubectl describe query my-query
```

#### Logs and Debugging

```bash
# View logs from a pod
kubectl logs pod-name

# Follow logs in real-time
kubectl logs -f pod-name

# Execute commands in a running container
kubectl exec -it pod-name -- /bin/bash
```

#### Managing Resources

```bash
# Apply an ARK configuration
kubectl apply -f my-query.yaml

# Delete a resource
kubectl delete query my-query

# Edit a resource in-place
kubectl edit query my-query
```

### Working with Namespaces

```bash
# List all namespaces
kubectl get namespaces

# Switch context to a specific namespace
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=my-namespace
```

### Useful Aliases

Add these to your shell configuration:

```bash
alias k=kubectl
alias kgp='kubectl get pods'
alias kgs='kubectl get svc'
alias kgn='kubectl get nodes'
```
